======================================

![platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-iOS-1111111.svg)

Depending on the context, it can take a frustrating number of steps to see today's date on iOS.

JKDateView demonstrates a date reveal feature concept as one way of addressing this pain point. 

The concept is simple: tapping the time in the top-left corner of the screen briefly shows the date in the unused space beneath the clock.

_Note: This demonstration is only visual (i.e. it does not actually implement any modifications to iOS on a system level)._
